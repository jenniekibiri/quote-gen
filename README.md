# quote generator  that generates random and custom quotes
## instructions for random quotes

The quotes are generated randomly one by one with each JavaScript call

Each quote is a combination of at least 3 sentence fragments (it's up to you to create these sentence fragments: beginning, middle, and end)

The quotes should be relatively coherent (no exclamation points in the middle of a sentence, for example)

## instructions for custom quotes

Select the number of quotes generated (between 1 and 5)

Choose between 2 types of quote generators (accordingly, you'll need two different sets of sentences)

Once the quotes are generated, have the program generate new quotes or quit the program

There's alot functions which reudce the length of the code by 50%
